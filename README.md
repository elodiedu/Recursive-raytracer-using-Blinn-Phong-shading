# Recursive-raytracer-using-Blinn-Phong-shading
This project implements a c++ raytracer that render traingulated faces .obj models into Blinn Phong shaded model. Recursive tracing enables the simulation of reflecting and refraction based on user defined material index. This model simulates the refractive and reflective surface more realistic than conventional rasterization model, with limited recursive iterations and frensel light reflection to keep the computation cost mamageable.


Input works for either UV mapped texture and user defined material parameter. 
Output is in P3 .ppm format.


Frensel lighting with Schlick approximation are added to the reflective surface to specify highlight. Smooth shading with barycentric interpolation are provided as an alternative for the flat shading, as vertex normals have been included.

**Camera Parameter:**


The camera orientation are defined from several parameters: eyepos, viewdir and updir. Eyepos defined the camera position in the world coordinates,viewdir is the camera facing direction and updir denotes the upward direction in the image frame. Imsize is the output pixel height and width for the image, and vfov shows the field of view for the camera, simulates distortion in wide angle camera with an vfov value greater than 90.

**Material Parameter:**


The parameter for the material in the input txt: Odr Odg Odb Osr Osg Osb ka kd ks n α η

Od and Os represents the diffuse and specular parameter in the Blinn Phong model; 

ka, kd and ks denotes the ambient, diffusive and specular reflective coefficiant; 

n represents the shiness component, α means opacity and η is the index of refraction.

**Light Parameter:**

Light is stored as input parameter attlight, multiple light with different direction could be applied. The format of the light entry is 
stored as a vector: 

x y z w i

x y z represents light position for point light, light direction for direction light, w represents light intesnity, with i defines light type: 1 = point light and 0 = directional light.

**Example output:**

The input files are included in the TestInput.txt.
